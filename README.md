Did We Have The Baby Yet?
=========================

Simple static birth announcement website in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Great for cutting down on incessant queries from family and friends near the due date. Just update `_data/baby.yml` with the information (don't forget to set `is_born: true`), update `images/baby.jpg`, and push when the baby comes.
